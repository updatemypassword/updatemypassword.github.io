Change My Password
==================

A directory of direct links to update the passwords of your accounts on various websites.

Inspired by justdelete.me.

Contributing
------------

The sites, urls and additional notes are stored in sites.json. If you want to add a site to the list you'll need the following information:

- `name`: The name of the service.
- `url`: The url of the page where the password can be changed. If such a page doesn't exist, the url should be a contact form or help page explaining the process.
- `info`: *(optional)* Notes will be shown when someone hovers over that service. They may include additional information you might need to update your password.

Contribution checklist
----------------------

1. Have you updated to the latest version of the project? `git pull`
2. If you have modified an existing service's difficulty, please explain why/give sources.
3. URLs must be direct links to either the change password page or, if this is not available, a relevant help article.
4. Any extra steps needed for the process should be detailed in the info (if necessary).
5. Be sure to indent 4 spaces per level.
6. Be sure to place your entry ALPHABETICALLY in the current list.
7. Please test that your changes work by going to `localhost` or `localhost/index.html`
